# Weekly Challenge #6 - Pretty Shape

**For this challenge, you need to implement a program that takes in some code and a shape and pretty prints the code to look like the shape.** The idea of this challenge is to play around layout algorithms and code formatting. There is no constraints in terms of programming language or kind of shapes to output.

### Winners:

* The winner of $100 is "Who Needs Prettier When You Have CSS?" by @aqandrew. The solution for the problem is just ü§Ø. I would have never thought about using CSS shape masks to be able to reformat your code. üëèüëèüëè https://github.com/Algorithm-Arena/weekly-challenge-6-pretty-shape/issues/1

* The second place of $35 goes to "Code Shape Up" by @luisperezphd. It is an extremely well executed implementation of the challenge. I especially love the "one last thing" at the end of the video! https://github.com/Algorithm-Arena/weekly-challenge-6-pretty-shape/issues/7



* The third place of $15 goes to "prettyPerson" by @morenicogs. Formatting your code based on your profile on your webcam is hillarious. I kind of want to try to code using this just for fun. https://github.com/Algorithm-Arena/weekly-challenge-6-pretty-shape/issues/6

* An honorary mention goes to "Format anything" by the first team of the challenge: @seanyang0813, @alexc19113800 and @kevinjzhang! Really cool use of SegmentAnything to be able to pick any image and get the shape you want. https://github.com/Algorithm-Arena/weekly-challenge-6-pretty-shape/issues/5

* An honorary mention goes to "Night Mountain CSS Shapify" by @nikpundik. I loved how there are empty comments /**/ added to represent the stars. This is so creative! https://github.com/Algorithm-Arena/weekly-challenge-6-pretty-shape/issues/3



* An honorary mention goes to "üéÑChristmaSSierüéÑ‚Äî an opinionated CSS formatter" by @sompylasar. Such a good idea to have the * selector be the star of the christmas tree built with CSS. All the rules are re-ordered to fit pattern. https://github.com/Algorithm-Arena/weekly-challenge-6-pretty-shape/issues/2

* An honorary mention goes to "Pretty print" by @evgenyvinnik. The biggest challenge is to figure out what to do with the overflow, the solution came with a unique twist resizing the text until it fits! https://github.com/Algorithm-Arena/weekly-challenge-6-pretty-shape/issues/4
