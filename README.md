# Weekly Challenge #6 - Pretty Shape

**For this challenge, you need to implement a program that takes in some code and a shape and pretty prints the code to look like the shape.** The idea of this challenge is to play around layout algorithms and code formatting. There is no constraints in terms of programming language or kind of shapes to output.
